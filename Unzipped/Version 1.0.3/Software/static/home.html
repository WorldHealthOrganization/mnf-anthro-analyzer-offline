    <h1>The Anthro Survey Analyser</h1>
    <p>The Anthro Survey Analyser is an online tool developed by the Department of Nutrition for Health and Development at the World Health Organization (WHO), that allows the user to perform comprehensive analysis of anthropometric survey data. The tool incorporates standard methodology as in the <a href="http://www.who.int/childgrowth/software">WHO Anthro Software Nutrition Survey module</a> and adds more accurate calculations of confidence intervals and standard errors around the estimates taking into account complex sample designs, whenever is the case. In addition to age, sex, type of residence and sub-regions/districts, the Anthro Survey Analyser provides also stratified analysis results by wealth quintiles, mother education and allows users to define one more stratification factor relevant to the survey/research.</p>
    <p>The tool is interactive and allows users to visualize outcomes on input data, z-score distributions, data quality assessment summaries. In addition, it provides a semi-filled summary survey report template with main results, including graphs and tables. The current version of the tool provides results for four of the anthropometric indexes: height-for-age, weight-for-age, weight-for-height and body-mass-index-for-age.
    Users are able to output two files in Excel format:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Z-score</strong> file based on the WHO Child Growth Standards: individual data including calculated z-scores and corresponding flags according to the WHO flagging system for identifying implausible values;</li>
      <li><strong>Prevalence</strong> file according to the WHO recommended standard analysis: includes prevalence estimates with corresponding standard errors and confidence intervals, and z-score summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) with most common cut-offs describing the full index distribution (-3, -2, -1, +1, +2, +3), and at disaggregated levels for all available factors (age, sex, type of residence, geographical regions, wealth quintiles, mother education and one additional factor the user is interested in and for which data are available); </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The summary survey report template is exported in Word.  It is a summary report template laying out guidance on minimum required details to follow good practice in reporting, including some output for data quality assessment. The report also includes main findings (graphics and tables) regarding prevalence estimates by different disaggregation factors for the five main indicators, namely stunting, wasting, severe wasting, overweight and underweight, as well as data quality assessment statistics.</p>
