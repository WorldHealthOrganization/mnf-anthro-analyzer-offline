                <p>Ensure that your data is prepared in the correct format for the Anthro Survey Analyser. Refer to the section on Data Preparation in the Quick Guide–specifically, the table on the accepted values for each variable–to find the best way to prepare your data to ensure that your variables will be mapped in the tool.</p>

                <h2>How do I prepare the data I want to use for the Anthro Survey Analyser?</h2>
                <p>The Anthro Survey Analyser does include validation checks for each mapped input variable used for the analysis, and provides user-friendly messages to guide the user in detecting potential mismatches. However, the user is strongly encouraged to <strong>perform preparation of the data prior</strong> to importing the file into the Anthro Survey Analyser. Table 1 provides guidance on accepted values for each of the variables to be mapped as input to the analysis and information on whether the variable is compulsory. In order to have the best accuracy for the output estimates, the user should know what the compulsory variables are as well as the recommended format for each of the mapped variables.</p>
                <p>The data file to be imported should be in a <strong>comma delimited format (.csv)</strong>. The file can be created in any spreadsheet software used for the organization, analysis, and storage of data in tabular form such as Microsoft Excel. Once the data is properly organised it can be saved as or transferred to a <code>.csv</code> format.</p>
                <p><strong>Attention</strong>: This application is based on R code. Therefore any variable label can only contain characters, numbers, <code>_</code>, and <code>-</code>. It should not include spaces or symbols. This also applies to the file name to be imported. For example, names such as <code>country survey.csv</code> or <code>survey2013&amp;2014</code> are not accepted.</p>

                <p>Variable mapping requires the user to manually select the variables from the dataset that corresponds to the variables used for analysis. As a part of the data validation, only the formats specified in Table 1 is possible for each variable selection. The tool is able to recognise the correct format for each variable.

                <h2>What are the outputs of the Anthro Survey Analyser?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <strong>z-score file</strong> based on the WHO Child Growth Standards: individual data, including calculated z-scores, and its corresponding flags based on the WHO flagging system for identifying implausible values.</li>
                    <li>A <strong>prevalence file</strong> based on the WHO recommended standard analysis: includes prevalence estimates with corresponding standard errors and confidence intervals; and z-score summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) with all cut-offs describing the full index distribution (-3, -2, -1, +1, +2, +3). All results are provided at overall and disaggregated levels for all available stratification variables (age, sex, type of residence, geographical regions, wealth quintiles, mother education and one additional factor the user is interested in for which the data are available).</li>
                    <li>A <strong>survey report template</strong> in Word format. This template lays out the minimum required details to follow the existing guidelines for good practice in reporting. The main findings are also included in the form of graphics and tables which depicts prevalence estimates and z-score distributions. These measures are further stratified by different group variables for the five main indicators?namely stunting, wasting, severe wasting, overweight, and underweight?as well as data quality assessment statistics and displays. This template aims to provide useful inputs of key findings and data quality assessment for a full survey report.</li>
                    <li>Graphics and figures: all graphics included in the application are in grayscale to allow for black and white printing. They can be downloaded whenever they are displayed.</li>

                <h2>Who will benefit from using the Anthro Survey Analyser?</h2>
                <p>The Anthro Survey Analyser is intended to be a useful tool for individuals in National Statistics Offices, data collection specialized agencies or programs, research centres, and any other institutions responsible for the analysis of anthropometric child indicators. It can be especially useful for users who do not have access to standard statistical software to analyse surveys.</p>

                <h2>What are its differences from the Anthro Software?</h2>
                <p>In terms of output, there are some additions in the Anthro Survey Analyser:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Outputs are provided in an <code><strong>expanded format</strong></code> with the following measures included:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The WHO Anthro Software included results disaggregated by age, sex, type of residence and sub-regions/districts, if available. The WHO Anthro Survey Analyser adds to those stratifications according to wealth quintiles, mother?s education, and any other country-specific relevant factor.</li>
                            <li>Calculations of confidence intervals and standard errors around the estimates take into account complex sample designs methodology whenever necessary.</li>
                            <li>The Anthro Software provides child malnutrition estimates for the most common cut-offs (e.g.stunting, which uses the indicator height-for-age below -2SD; or wasting, using the indicator weight-for-height below -2SD, and others). The tool provides cut-offs for all four indexes at -3SD, -2SD, -1SD, +1SD, +2SD, and +3SD.<br />
                            </li>
                            <li>For each index, weighted and unweighted sample sizes are provided.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>In addition to the online graphics and tables that can be easily downloaded, the tool provides a summary report template which includes main findings and key outputs for data quality assessment based on existing best practices for reporting.</li>
