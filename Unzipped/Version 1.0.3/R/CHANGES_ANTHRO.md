Small changes have been made to this R distribution and packages in the library folder in order to save space.

* Removed R/doc and R/tests
* Removed all man folders within packages
* Removed c++ header files

If you want to use R, please go to r-project.org and use the most recent version there. This local distribution is tailored towards running one shiny app.
